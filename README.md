# Equation of a plane in 3D

Given some point ***'p'*** on a plane and a normal vector ***'n'*** to that plane,
the equation of the plane can thus be written as:

***n*** = < a, b, c >

***p*** = < x0, y0, z0 >

some vector variable 'v' = < x, y, z >

1. ***Standard form***
   - > a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) +  c(z - z0) = 0
  
   - ***Stems from the idea that the dot-product between two orthogonal vectors( n.(v - p) ) has to equal zero***

2. ***General form***
   - > ax + by + cz = d
   -  Since the ***'n'***  and ***'p'*** vectors are known constants; if you then apply the *distributive property* to the first equation, collect like terms, and re-arrange the whole expression; you get this compact version. Therefore, the dot-product between the plane normal and a plane point should equal ***d***
